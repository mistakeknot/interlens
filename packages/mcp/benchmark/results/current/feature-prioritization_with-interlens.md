# Solution: Feature Prioritization Deadlock (With Interlens)

## Applying FLUX Lenses: Explore vs Exploit + Pace Layering + Innovation Portfolio

*[Using interlens to search for "strategic prioritization time horizons"]*

RICE optimizes for exploit (known value). You also need explore (unknown value). Single framework can't serve both.

## Through Explore vs Exploit: Different Types of Value

Your roadmap has fundamentally different types of work:

**Exploit (Proven Value):**
- Customer requests = known demand, incremental improvement
- High confidence, measurable impact
- RICE works perfectly here

**Explore (Uncertain Value):**
- Strategic bets = unknown demand, transformational potential
- Low confidence, hard-to-measure impact
- RICE actively penalizes this work

**Sustain (Foundation):**
- Tech debt = enables future velocity
- No direct customer impact
- RICE doesn't measure this at all

## Root Cause: Using Fast-Layer Metrics to Evaluate Slow-Layer Bets

Through Pace Layering, your work operates at different time scales:

**Fast Layer (Quarterly): Customer Requests**
- Satisfy current customers
- Prevent churn
- Measurable impact NOW
- RICE: Optimizes for reach/impact in current quarter

**Slow Layer (2-year): Strategic Bets**
- Build competitive moat
- Position for future market
- Impact measured in YEARS
- RICE: Can't measure 2-year value with quarterly metrics

**Foundation Layer (Ongoing): Tech Debt**
- Enables all future work
- Prevents collapse
- Velocity multiplier
- RICE: Doesn't capture "enables future features"

## The Breakthrough: Portfolio Approach with Layered Frameworks

Don't use one framework for all layers. Match framework to time horizon.

**Fast Layer (50% capacity): Exploit**
- Use RICE for customer requests
- Quarterly impact, retention goals
- High certainty, incremental value
- **Includes**: Top customer's churn-risk feature (#3 RICE)

**Slow Layer (35% capacity): Explore**
- Use different criteria: Strategic fit, learning value, competitive positioning
- 2-year market position
- High uncertainty, transformational potential
- **NOT RICE-scored** (wrong metrics for slow layer)
- Pick ONE strategic bet (AI assistant OR automation, not both)

**Foundation Layer (15% capacity): Sustain**
- Score by "Does this unlock future features?"
- Velocity impact, not customer impact
- **NOT RICE-scored** (measures wrong outcome)

## Why Customer Request AND Strategic Bet Can Co-exist

Through Pace Layering:
- Fast layer keeps business running (retention, cash flow)
- Slow layer builds future (differentiation, growth)
- Foundation prevents collapse (tech debt bankruptcy)

**For top customer's request (#3 RICE):**
- Fast layer allocation: Yes, build it (retention is fast-layer job)
- Doesn't conflict with AI assistant (slow-layer job)
- Different layers, different purposes

## Implementation: Pace-Layered Q1 Roadmap

**Fast Layer (50% = ~5-6 features):**
- Timeline entry editing (#3 RICE, prevents churn)
- Top 4-5 other customer requests by RICE
- Goal: Quarterly retention, NPS >50

**Slow Layer (35% = focused bet):**
- AI assistant (NOT automation, pick ONE)
- 3-4 engineers dedicated for full quarter
- Goal: Beta launch, learn if customers value it
- Success metric: Not usage (too early), but "Did we learn?"

**Foundation Layer (15% = dedicated time):**
- Refactor authentication system (unlocks SSO feature requests)
- Performance improvements (enables mobile app)
- Goal: Velocity increases 20% in Q2

## Why RICE Failed You

RICE optimizes for:
- **R**each: How many users NOW
- **I**mpact: How much value NOW
- **C**onfidence: How certain we are NOW
- **E**ffort: Cost to build NOW

It can't optimize for:
- Strategic value in 2 years (slow layer)
- Velocity improvements (foundation layer)
- Learning from experiments (explore)

## The Meta-Insight: Framework Applicability Boundaries

**Question:** "How do we prioritize when framework says one thing, strategy says another?"

**Answer:** The framework (RICE) has applicability boundaries.

- **RICE works for**: Fast-layer exploit work (customer requests)
- **RICE fails for**: Slow-layer explore work (strategic bets) and foundation work (tech debt)

Through Innovation Portfolio theory:
- Portfolios need diversity across risk/return profiles
- Roadmap = portfolio of bets at different time scales
- Can't optimize entire portfolio with single framework

## Trade-offs Made Explicit

**If you go 100% customer requests (fast layer):**
- Pro: Maximize short-term NPS, retention
- Con: No competitive differentiation, competitor catches up in 1-2 years
- Result: Slow death (customers gradually leave for better alternatives)

**If you go 100% strategic bets (slow layer):**
- Pro: Future differentiation
- Con: Customers churn NOW (no fast-layer satisfaction)
- Result: Fast death (run out of customers before strategic bets pay off)

**Pace-layered portfolio (50/35/15):**
- Fast layer: Keeps business alive
- Slow layer: Builds future
- Foundation: Prevents collapse
- Result: Sustainable growth

## Validation: How to Present This to Leadership

**CEO (wants strategy):**
"We're investing 35% in AI assistant (focused, not split). This is 3-4 engineers full-time for Q1. That's a real strategic bet."

**Head of CS (wants retention):**
"We're building top 5-6 customer requests by RICE, including the churn-risk feature. That's 50% of capacity on proven retention work."

**Engineering (wants tech debt):**
"We're dedicating 15% to velocity-multiplying tech debt. This will speed up Q2-Q4 delivery."

**All three stakeholders:** "Everyone's priority is represented. Trade-offs are explicit and balanced."

## How to Handle Framework Conflicts Going Forward

When RICE says one thing, strategy says another:

1. **Ask: What layer is this work?**
   - Fast layer → Use RICE
   - Slow layer → Use strategic fit
   - Foundation → Use velocity impact

2. **Don't force slow-layer work into fast-layer metrics**
   - AI assistant gets low RICE score? Expected (it's slow-layer work)
   - Doesn't mean it's low value, means RICE is wrong tool

3. **Portfolio balance over framework purity**
   - Better to use right framework per layer than wrong framework for all

## Success Metrics (Q1)

**Fast Layer:**
- Customer churn: <5% (prevented with timeline feature)
- NPS: >50 (customer requests delivered)

**Slow Layer:**
- AI assistant beta: Launched to 100 users
- Learning: Validated (or invalidated) hypothesis

**Foundation:**
- Velocity: +20% in Q2 (from tech debt fixes)
- Bug rate: -30% (from foundation improvements)

The breakthrough: Match prioritization framework to time horizon. RICE for fast, strategic fit for slow, velocity impact for foundation.

No single framework optimizes across all layers - that's why you have deadlock.
