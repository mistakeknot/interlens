# interlens Philosophy

## Purpose
288 FLUX cognitive lenses for structured thinking — MCP server with lens search, thinking mode workflows, belief statement generation, quality evaluation, and solution synthesis.

## North Star
Improve thinking quality without adding noise: lenses should increase decision clarity, not cognitive overhead.

## Working Priorities
- Cognitive clarity
- Actionable lenses
- Low overhead

## Brainstorming Doctrine
1. Start from outcomes and failure modes, not implementation details.
2. Generate at least three options: conservative, balanced, and aggressive.
3. Explicitly call out assumptions, unknowns, and dependency risk across modules.
4. Prefer ideas that improve clarity, reversibility, and operational visibility.

## Planning Doctrine
1. Convert selected direction into small, testable, reversible slices.
2. Define acceptance criteria, verification steps, and rollback path for each slice.
3. Sequence dependencies explicitly and keep integration contracts narrow.
4. Reserve optimization work until correctness and reliability are proven.

## Decision Filters
- Does this reduce ambiguity for future sessions?
- Does this improve reliability without inflating cognitive load?
- Is the change observable, measurable, and easy to verify?
- Can we revert safely if assumptions fail?
