## Title
Competitor Launched Similar Product - Pivot or Double Down?

## Context
- Project management tool for marketing teams
- 12 months in market, 2,000 users, $80k MRR
- Growing 15% month-over-month
- Last week: Major competitor (Monday.com) launched marketing-specific features
- They have 100x more users, brand recognition, resources
- Team morale hit hard

## Challenge
Founders debate:
- Pivot to adjacent market (creative agencies vs marketing teams)?
- Double down on differentiation (we're specialized, they're general)?
- Pivot to different problem space entirely?

Data conflicted:
- Current customers love product (NPS: 65)
- But new signups dropped 40% after competitor announcement
- Market size shrinking if competitor takes 80%

Your role: Decide pivot strategy given competitive pressure.

## Prompt for Agent

```
Major competitor just launched into our market.
They have 100x our resources and brand.

Current state:
- 2,000 users, $80k MRR, 15% monthly growth
- NPS: 65 (customers love us)
- New signups: -40% after their announcement

Do we:
- Pivot to different market?
- Double down on our specialization?
- Pivot to different problem?

How do we survive against 100x bigger competitor?
```

## Expected Lens Relevance

**High:** Explore vs Exploit, Strategic Choice, Competitive Dynamics, Differentiation
**Medium:** Pace Layering, System Boundaries
**Low:** Accessibility

## Baseline Solution

"Find a niche they can't serve. Or pivot to completely different market."

- Originality: 3/10

## Target Solution

Using Explore vs Exploit + Pace Layering:

"This isn't about pivot. It's about time arbitrage.

Through Explore vs Exploit:
- Competitor exploits (serves mass market, general features)
- You explore (specialized, deep marketing workflows)

Through Pace Layering:
- Competitor moves slowly (big company, many stakeholders)
- You move quickly (small team, direct customer access)

Your advantage: SPEED in slow-moving parts, DEPTH in their shallow parts.

Strategy: Don't compete on breadth. Compete on depth + speed.

Find the slow layer competitors can't serve:
- Deep integrations (they won't build for 2,000 users)
- Rapid feature iteration (they ship quarterly, you ship weekly)
- Specialized workflows (uneconomical for them)

Current customers stay (NPS 65) because you're deeper.
New signups down because you LOOK similar at surface.

Solution: Make depth visible
- Showcase integrations competitor doesn't have
- Show workflow specialization
- Demonstrate speed (ship features customers request in days)

The breakthrough: You can't outscale them. Outspecialize and outspeed them."

- Originality: 8/10
- Time/depth arbitrage vs pivot

## Evaluation Notes
